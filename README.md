<h1 align="left">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Nikolai Gordienko</h1>
<h3 align="left">I'm currently learning Python</h3>
<p>My name is Nikolay, and I am a SAP consultant. I have been working with SAP systems for several years and have a deep understanding of how these systems work and how to customize them to meet the specific needs of my clients. I am excited to learn Python and explore the many possibilities it offers for developing a wide range of applications.</p>
<p>As a SAP consultant, I believe that Python can be a valuable tool for automating many of the tasks that I perform on a daily basis and for building powerful data analysis and visualization tools. I am proficient in the use of command line, Git, and setting up a Python environment. I have experience with dictionaries, sets, functions, declarative programming, and automated testing in Python. I am skilled in SQL and experienced in working with databases. I am familiar with the basics of web development in Python, including regular expressions, the HTTP protocol, and OOP. I am also able to develop web applications using the Flask framework.</p>
<p>I have experience working with relational databases and have completed successful projects, including games of the mind, a difference calculator, and a page analyzer. I am confident in my ability to contribute to a team and deliver high-quality results.</p>
<p>In my free time, I enjoy reading books and articles about programming, attending online courses and workshops, and working on my own projects. I am also a member of several online communities and forums where I can learn from other experienced developers and share my own knowledge and experience.</p>
<p>If you are interested in my work or have any questions, please feel free to contact me. I am always happy to discuss new opportunities and challenges in the field of programming and SAP consulting. ðŸ˜Š</p>
